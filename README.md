# TOP-calculator

Calculator project from the Odin Project

### To implement

- [ ] A way to handle long numbers. Ideally shrink the font size, or easier, create a line break
- [x] Decimal point should only be addable once per number
- [ ] Code isn't DRY yet, for example the "divide by 0" failsafe
- [ ] Make buttons light up when pressing their respective keys
