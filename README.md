# TOP-calculator

Calculator project from the Odin Project

### To implement

- [x] A way to handle long numbers. Ideally shrink the font size, or easier, create a line break
- [x] Decimal point should only be addable once per number
- [x] No more than 16 digits per number. 9007199254740991 is max safe int
- [x] Add 1000 separators for big numbers (1.000.000,56)
- [x] Make buttons light up when pressing their respective keys
- [x] root and exponent not working.
- [x] Having a big number with shrunken fontsize, and then pressing ESC will cause the font to stay small for
      the initial 0
- [x] BUG: make calculation (eg. x + y), press calc. then start typing new number
- [x] make calculation and press calc. now typing numbers should reset calculator?
- [x] proper display for exponents and roots in history display
- [x] fancy font for display?
- [x] make root and exponent look good in history display
- [ ] Code isn't DRY yet, for example the "divide by 0" failsafe. REFACTOR!
- [ ] make horizontal layout
