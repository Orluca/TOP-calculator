### To implement

- [x] A way to handle long numbers. Ideally shrink the font size, or easier, create a line break

- [x] No more than 16 digits per number. 9007199254740991 is max safe int
- [x] Add 1000 separators for big numbers (1.000.000,56)
- [ ] Code isn't DRY yet, for example the "divide by 0" failsafe
- [ ] Make buttons light up when pressing their respective keys
